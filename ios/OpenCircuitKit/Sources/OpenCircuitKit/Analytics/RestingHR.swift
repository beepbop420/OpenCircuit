// Resting heart rate (daily) — derived on-device; the ring does not report it (#18, #37).
//
// Two tiers, in preference order:
//   1. Sleep mean — the average HR across the night's `asleep*` segments. Sleeping HR is
//      the most stable, least motion-contaminated signal, so its mean is the best single
//      resting estimate when sleep staging is available.
//   2. Lowest sustained — the minimum of a rolling `window`-length mean (default 5 min).
//      This mirrors the convention Apple Health uses for its own resting-HR estimate
//      (lowest sustained HR during inactivity), so our value sits alongside Apple's on a
//      comparable basis. Requiring a multi-reading window rejects single-reading dips.
//
// Coverage floor on tier 2 (#298), OPT-IN: a caller that shows or alerts on a day's value passes
// `dayCoverage`, and a day whose value would come from tier 2 on fewer readings, or a shorter
// span of them, than the floor gets NO value — exactly as if it had no readings. Without it, the
// few awake readings synced so far today became "today's resting HR" (≈ the current HR) and raised
// an elevated-RHR WATCH. The default (nil) is the old behaviour, unchanged, so the Apple Health
// resting-HR write and the basal-energy scaling see the same values they always did.
//
// Pure value-type math (no HealthKit / device types) so it unit-tests on macOS.
